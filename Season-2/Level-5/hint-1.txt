We can provide a malicious object as the parameter for CryptoAPI.sha1.hash().
What does this trigger? 

Example:
$ var s = { toString: function() { alert('Exploit 1'); } };
$ CryptoAPI.sha1.hash(s)

Do you want to visualize the above? Follow these instructions:

1. Double click index.html to open it in any browser. Are you using GitHub Codespaces?

// Please note that if you are inside a codespace, it is not possible to perform step 1.
// Instead, run the following in terminal from the root of the game level (Season-2/Level-5/):
//    `python3 -m http.server`
// Once running, select on the "ports" tab of the codespace and click on the URL that exposes
// port 8000. Navigating to the URL should serve the HTML and vulnerable JavaScript.
// Proceed with the remaining steps.

2. Copy the first line of the example, paste it in the javascript console and press enter.

3. Now copy the second line, paste it in the javascript console and press enter.

4. A popup should appear with the text "Exploit 1" in it. If it does, the exploit was successful.
