Have a look inside .github/workflows/jarvis.yml.
A strange GitHub Action is being used and a secret value is sent to it as an input... This doesn't look good!
Do we really need a third party GitHub Action to "Check GitHub Status" (https://www.githubstatus.com/api/v2/status.json)?
Can you replace the "Check GitHub Status" step without using any dependencies at all?
